<h2 align="center">How to get ability</h2>
<p align="center">
  When enemy is destroyed, game checks if ability slot is empty and if chance to draw ability is high enough. Then ability is choosen randomly, and compared with chance to get it, if everything is ok, ability is added to the slot.

<h2 align="center">How abilities work</h2>
<p align="center">
  To use the ability player has to press RMB, each ability spawns a gameobject with a script that executed on awake.
  CorruptionReduction has a script that on awake gets player stats and reduces corruption by a set percent and updates players color.
  <br><br>
  Abilities can work together, PowerSurge will make player shoot very very fast for a few seconds, but enemies can still attack player from the back. By combining it with RadianBurst, player will be safe from any attacks.
