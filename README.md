    BlueVRed2 is a new version of my original BlueVRed.
    Inspiration for this project was one of my first game made in javascript, it looked similarly to current version but lacked a lot of features.
    Now, BlueVRed2 is a top down shooter with blue player fighting against more and more red enemies.
