EnemySpawner uses timer to check when enemy should be spawned. Enemies can't be placed in a random place, this would result in player being attack without the chance to fight back.
<br>
First one of 4 sides is randomly choosen, then random offset is generated, depending on a side, and added to spawn position, using this EnemySpawner spawn enemy outside of players view everytime and resets the timer.
